This is a simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on an emoji-based button. The computer then randomly chooses its move, and the result (win, lose, or tie) is displayed with emoji icons and a message. A "Reset Score" button is included to refresh the score tracking. The UI features a clean, modern design with large clickable icons.
